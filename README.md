# Store-Database-SQL
Database systems in SQL are where a store database is developed. 
Collaborated with a team to develop a store database that allows customers to order items by category, check product pricing, view delivery options, and track order status. 
Designed the database using flowcharts and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), creating a comprehensive schema that included entities, tuples, attributes, and defined primary and foreign keys.
Implemented the database using MySQL and developed a Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction, enabling the ability to perform INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations on all database tables.
